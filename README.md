# MIT6.S081-xv64-lab

This repository contains my solution to the labs for MIT's 6.S081 operating system.

## How to use it ?

First, you need to clone this repository by

```c
git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2021
```

Then cd into the file, you are now in the master branch of the projects, to see my answer to a specific lab, e.g. util, syscall ...... , you just checkout into that branch by for example 

```
git checkout util
```

and now you are in the utils branch which contains my solution to the specific lab. 

if you want to have a clean copy of the original lab handout, just go to the [course website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html) and follow the lab guidance. Also, you can watch the course videos on the course website. Hope you enjoy your OS journey.
